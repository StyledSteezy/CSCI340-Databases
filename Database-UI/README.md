# Database UI Project
The goal for this project was to use the programming language of my choice (that has a library that can connect to PostgreSQL) and the UI framework of my choice to build a user interface for our DB overflow database. I chose to use Flask because it was quick and easy to get started. Flask also offers good processes that make interacting with a database and file directory very intuitive. The website did not have to look pretty, it just needed to be functional. Although I should note that this was my first time using Flask. Therefore, my knowledge and experience with this framework have grown a lot.

## UI Requirements
UI should support the following features while being attentive to the fact that users are humans:
1. Ask a question.
2. Browse questions with at least some filtering if not full search.
3. Answer a question.
4. View some basic aggregate information:
    - Top scoring questions.
    - Longest unanswered questions.
    - Day with the most questions asked.
    - Day with the most answers given.
    - Most active user.
