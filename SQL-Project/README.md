# SQL Project
The goal for this project was to use the programming language of my choice (that has a library that can connect to PostgreSQL) to extract information from our database. I chose Python and used the Jupyter Notebook environment because it was easy to work on one question at a time all in one place. In Homework 1 we were able to connect to our database and perform SELECT queries to extract information. For this Project we needed to do the same thing, but from within a programming language in order to do more powerful data manipulation.

## SQL Requirements
Write programs that connect to the database to perform the following computations and analysis:
1. Find the highest scoring question with a unique tag.
2. Pick a holiday and try to find the highest scoring answers relevant to that holiday.
